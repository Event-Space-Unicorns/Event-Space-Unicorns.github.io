# Introducing Eventer - the ultimate event browsing and planning tool

Ever been planning a public event in the hopes of reaching just the right audience and obtaining high attendance levels? One of the first questions to be tackled is when to have the event and how to avoid overlap with other very similar happenings that could compete over the same participants.

Taking a look at the events listings and calendars will not help you with the issue, as they will not tell how the events are distributed in time or space, and any useful information is lost under loads of irrelevant details.

## Our solution

Our event planning tool Eventer will take the same data and turn it into easily digestible, visual format. You can explore the events at a certain time, in a given area or by some meaningful category or keyword.

### Number of weekly events by municipality

Get an overview of quiet and busy periods in your city to avoid peak times and competition. Maybe spot a slow week and spur up some action to fill in the gap?

Don't be in the dark when it comes to planning your Halloween event be it for kids and families or an adult audience.
